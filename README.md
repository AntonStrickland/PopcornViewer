# PopcornViewer

**Dependencies**

Popcorn Viewer requires the [google-gdata .NET library](https://developers.google.com/gdata/docs/client-libraries) and [Adobe Flashplayer](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/).

**Our Mission Statement**

What we hope to accomplish is simple: We want to bring friends and families across the globe closer together. Watching a movie is commonly considered a family past-time and groups of friends often gather for a weekly movie night. As time passes, people often relocate and have to leave their loved ones behind. This is especially true for military personnel and those who do business in a global setting. With Popcorn Viewer, friends and family will once again be able to share in those magical moments of bonding even if they cannot physically be together.

**How to Compile in Visual Studio**

**1.** [Download](https://github.com/AntonStrickland/PopcornViewer/archive/master.zip) and unzip the source code or clone the repository.

**2.** Open PopcornViewer.sln in Visual Studio.

**3.** Choose "PROJECT" from the toolstrip menu and select the option "Add Reference...".

**4.** Browse to your installation location of the Google Data API default being "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Google Data API SDK\Redist".

**5.** Select Google.GData.Client.dll, Google.GData.YouTube.dll, and Google.GData.Extensions.dll.

At this point you will be able to edit and compile the code as you see fit.
